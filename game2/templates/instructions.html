In each round, a flag will appear on the screen. Your job is to name the country as fast as you can.There are three players in this game: Player One, that’s you. Player Two, your friend. And the A.I. Player, a computer that thinks it knows all the answers. You can answer in two ways: either type the name of the country or say it out loud into the microphone. If you’re stuck, don’t worry! You can hover over the flag to get a hint. For every correct answer, you earn one point. At the end of the game, we’ll add up the scores to see who wins. But here’s an important rule: Both players must enter their answers before submitting. The computer will guess too, so try your best to beat it. Once all three rounds are finished, the final scores will be revealed. Will you be the Ultimate Flag Champion? There’s only one way to find out!Alright, get ready The game is about to begin!')"
